# Meetly
# Meetly is our application that helps groups find the best time and event to meet by combining
# user preferences, calendar availability (via Google Calendar) and a machine learning
# recommandation engine. 

# --- Setup of the App ---
# To use the App we created a Google Account where we merged all of our personal calendars.
# That's how we ensured, that all our calendars are combined. This is the calendar we then 
# integrated through an API into our App.
