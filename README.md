# Meetly
# Meetly is our application that helps groups find the best time and event to meet by combining user preferences, calendar availability (via Google Calendar) and a machine learning recommandation engine. 

# --- Setup of the App ---
# To use the App we created a Google Account where we merged all of our personal calendars. That's how we ensured, that all our calendars are combined. This is the calendar we then integrated through an API into our App.
